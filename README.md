# Inventory_Management_with_blutooth_using_arduino

Steps for using this project :-

Please upload INventory_manager_with_bluetooth,ino to Arduino nano 

and 

Extract the zip file and copy the "ArduImageCapture" folder into your Arduino "tools" folder next to the Arduino "libraries" folder. If the "tools" folder doesn't exist, then you can create it yourself. 

also to use camera module you can follow this link
